 * @brief  	Functions to control the states of the leds. It is the module used to control the leds.
 * 			If one tries to set a led outside of this module, it will probably not work as intended, as
 * 			this module updates the states of the leds.
 * 			Reads the events generated by the other modules in order to decide what to do with the leds
